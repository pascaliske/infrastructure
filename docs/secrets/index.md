# Secrets

Almost all services require some kind of secret value at runtime. In order to store those secrets safely inside the Git repository I use **Mozilla SOPS** which is [natively supported by Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/) – more precisely, I use [`age`](https://age-encryption.org) as an algorithm for encryption.

!!! info

    Please keep in mind that this page is only meant as an example implementation of my workflow. You're free to adapt it, but you will need to adjust it by yourself.

## Prerequisites

It is required to have SOPS and `age` installed on your machine. You can leverage `brew` for that:

```sh
$ brew install sops age
```

You also need to [generate a key](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/#encrypting-secrets-using-age) for `age` and [enable the Flux controllers to decrypt](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/#configure-in-cluster-secrets-decryption) your secrets.

!!! tip "Store `age` key in environment variable"

    This repository provides some [task definitions](#commands) to easily maintain SOPS encrypted files. To use them you just need to ensure your `age` public key is available in an environment variable called `AGE_PUBLIC_KEY`.

## Workflow

Let's assume you want to deploy an application which needs the following secret to connect to a database:

```yaml title="db-user.sops.yaml" linenums="1"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgresql-user
  namespace: my-app
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: my-app
  password: $uper$ecret123
```

To store the secret safely in the Git repository, you would do the following:

1. You create the secret manifest locally and name it e.g. `db-user.sops.yaml`
2. [Encrypt](#encryption) the file using SOPS & `age`
3. Specify the secret inside the `Deployment` as you normally would
4. Commit the files to the Git repository

As soon as the commit is pushed to the Git repository, the following happens inside the cluster:

1. `source-controller` pulls the changes from Git
2. `kustomize-controller` loads the `age` keys from the `sops-age` secret
3. `kustomize-controller` decrypts your secret and applies it on the cluster

## Commands

### Encryption

The following commands allow you to encrypt any YAML or JSON file and store it inside the Git repository:

=== "Kubernetes `Secret`"

    ```shell
    $ task sops:encrypt:secret -- path/to/my/secret.sops.yaml
    ```

=== "Generic YAML"

    ```shell
    $ task sops:encrypt:generic -- path/to/my/secret.sops.yaml
    ```

### Decryption

If you need to modify the secret value later on, you can decrypt it locally – as long as the private age key exists on your machine:

=== "Kubernetes `Secret`"

    ```shell
    $ task sops:decrypt:secret -- path/to/my/secret.sops.yaml
    ```

=== "Generic YAML"

    ```shell
    $ task sops:decrypt:generic -- path/to/my/secret.sops.yaml
    ```
