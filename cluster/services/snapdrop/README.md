# `snapdrop`

## Introduction

> A progressive web app for local file sharing inside the browser. Files are sent only between peers and are never sent to any server.

I'm a huge fan of Apples AirDrop for simply sharing files between devices. But due to some non Apple devices I needed an alternative and found `snapdrop`. It provides a easy to use a d secure way to transfer files between devices with potentially different operating systems.
